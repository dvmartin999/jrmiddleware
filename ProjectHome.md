Jr 3.1 (pronounced Junior) Middleware is a SAE AS-4 (JAUS) AS-5669/5669A compliant software development tool for the management and routing of network traffic in distributed systems, with specific appliction to unmanned systems. With existing support for UDP, TCP and serial interfaces, Jr eliminates the burden of designing, building and maintaining infrastructure software allowing developers to focus on domain specific issues.

Jr Middleware is a reliable solution that features a C-style API accessed through a shared library or linked directly with the users application. The same functions enable routing and delivery of messages to local destinations or remote hosts over an IP-based network.  This API is defined in C and can be used with C/C++, Visual Basic, C# and Java. Jr also provides an XML-based configuration file allowing for performance optimizations to your network environment. Default values have been carefully selected to ensure optimal performance for most applications.

Jr Middleware's single API provides support for inter-process and network communications. This allows system designers to quickly migrate software components from local to remote hosts. By maintaining compliance with the SAE AS-4 (JAUS) AS-5669 Standard, Jr offers enhanced support for run-time discovery, message relay, prioritization, guaranteed delivery and large packet segmentation.
